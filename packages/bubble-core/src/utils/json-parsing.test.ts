If you are a developer and have used workflow builders like Zapier, Make, or n8n, you will immediately notice the flexibility and power of owning your flows in code. That said, our chat-to-workflow interface makes it easy for anyone to start building right away.\n\nHow do I build workflows?\n\nUse one of our templates or describe what you want in natural language, and Bubble Lab will generate the workflow instantly. From there you can visualize, edit from the code editor, and export it as clean TypeScript code that you can run anywhere.\n\nWhat is the difference between self hosting and using the cloud version?\n\nThe cloud version lets you start instantly: hosting, OAuth, and setup are all managed for you, and it includes starter credits so you can begin running workflows right away. The self-hosted version gives you full control to run Bubble Lab on your own infrastructure, manage your own secrets, and scale without limits.\n\nWhat if there is a Bubble integration that is missing?\n\nTell us what you need! We are actively prioritizing new Bubbles based on community demand- your request could be next on the list.\n\nIs Bubble Lab open source?\n\nYES! We are open-sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We love contributions and welcome them!\n\n![Bubble Lab Logo](https://bubblelab.ai/logo.png)\n\n## Automate with Bubble Lab\n\nBuild Now"}`;
