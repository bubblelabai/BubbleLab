# Manual Testing for Bubble Core

This directory contains scripts for manually testing Bubble Core integrations with real APIs and external services. These tests are intended for scenarios that require live credentials, network access, or significant resources, and may take longer to run than standard unit tests.

> **Note:**  
> For fast, automated unit tests, use:
>
> ```
> pnpm run test
> ```
>
> Use the manual tests in this directory when you need to verify real-world behavior, debug integration issues, or validate changes against live systems.
